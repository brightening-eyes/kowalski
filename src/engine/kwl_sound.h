/**
 * <p>Valid sound playback modes, describing how the next audio 
 * data item is selected from the sound's audio data list 
 * when the current item has finished playing.</p>
 * The behaviour when the referencing event is stopped is determined
 * by the combination of the playback mode and the value of the \c deferStop
 * flag of the \c kwlSound struct. The following timeline diagram shows the behaviour
 * for different combinations of playback modes and \deferStop values.
 * A sound with five audio data items, each one second long, is used in this example.
 * The \c playbackCount is -1, which means new items are selected until the referencing
 * event is requested to stop.
