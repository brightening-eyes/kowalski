    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This package contains the Kowalski Engine Java bindings. The API
is very similar to that defined in the Kowalski Engine C header kowalski.h.
One slight difference to be aware of is that the typedefs kwlEventHandle and friends
do not exist in the Java version, but are instead represented by whatever primitive
type the typedefs resolve to. The Kowalski Engine API is exposed through the
static class Kowalski, so a call to a method kwlXXX in the C api translates
to the Java call Kowalski.kwlXXX.
